## ![](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/circle-icons-1/64/document-24.png)Searching Through Different Logs


This program allows the user to create unordered list from the Catalina Log, Error Log, or Access log.Upon selecting one of the logs the user gets presented with a menu that includes

* Prints the log
* display size of the log
* search for entries between dates
* search for specific word
* exit

A linked list is used in order to seperate each entry with all the information. All the logs have different configurations so each log gets broken down differently.
